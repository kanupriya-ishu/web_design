                        The Alchemist (Portuguese: O Alquimista) is a novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho that was first 
                        published in 1988. Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely translated international bestseller.
                        An allegorical novel, The Alchemist follows a young Andalusian shepherd in his journey to the pyramids of Egypt,
                        after having a recurring dream of finding a treasure there.<br>
                        The book's main theme is about finding one's destiny, although according to The New York Times, The Alchemist is
                        "more self-help than literature". The advice given Santiago that "when you really want something to happen,
                        the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true" is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays throughout it.

                      Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It advocates the importance of financial 
                      literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing,
                      starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence (financial IQ) to improve one's business
                      and financial aptitude. Robert Kiyosaki followed the book with Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing.
                      He has at least a dozen books published.  
                      <br>
                      Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's life.
                      The titular "rich dad" is his friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, 
                      while the "poor dad" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained 
                      financial security. No one has ever proven that Rich Dad, the man who supposedly gave Kiyosaki all his advice for 
                      wealthy living, ever existed. Nor has anyone ever documented any vast reserves of wealth earned by Kiyosaki prior to
                      the publication of Rich Dad, Poor Dad in 1997.

                    The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is simply written and tries to be free of culture or religion. It is slightly
                    repetitive, but this in itself mirrors the book's idea of subconscious programming. (For full effect, the author's 
                    advice that it be read at least twice should be taken.) It is also sometimes a bit whimsical and illogical - a bit 
                    like the subconscious itself, but Murphy's whole point, in fact, is that if you refuse to try to understand the 
                    non-rational mind, your rational desires and plans will be forever sabotaged.
                    <br>
                    The first half of the book is the best, as it explains how the subconscious works. The second half deals with its 
                    role and power to transform in areas like marriage, human relations, scientific discovery, sleep, fear, forgiveness 
                    and 'eternal youth'.

                    The book is a business fable

                    Think and Grow Rich was written by Napoleon Hill in 1937 and promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book.

                    To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. Instantly successful, widely read in high schools 
                    and middle schools in the United States, it has become a classic of modern American literature, winning the Pulitzer 
                    Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that 
                    occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.
                    <br>
                    Despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. 
                    Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. 
                    The historian Joseph Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read 
                    book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial 
                    heroism."
                    <br>
                    As a Southern Gothic and Bildungsroman novel, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the 
                    destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles 
                    in the Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry 
                    prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often 
                    challenged for its use of racial epithets.
